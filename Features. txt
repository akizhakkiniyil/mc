Mcp client features

You're asking for the core of intelligent AI applications: moving beyond simple data retrieval to complex reasoning and structured output. The example code I provided in the previous response is specifically designed to address these requirements for your access governance use case.
Let's break down how the provided code achieves "structured output for the Tree-of-Thoughts method from the MCP server side" and "guided by precise prompt instructions, moving beyond basic retrieval to a more inferential and analytical task in the MCP client side."
1. Structured Output for "Tree-of-Thoughts" from the MCP Server Side
On the access-governance-mcp-server side, the goal is not just to return raw data, but to provide data in a structured, interconnected way that facilitates complex reasoning by the LLM. This is achieved through the EmployeeContextGraph POJO and the Get_Employee_Context_Graph tool:
 * EmployeeContextGraph.java (in access-governance-mcp-server/src/main/java/com/example/accessgovernance/service/model/):
   This is a custom Java POJO designed to encapsulate a rich, hierarchical view of an employee's context. It includes:
   * employeeDetails: The core employee information.
   * lineManagerDetails: Details of their direct manager.
   * directReports: A list of employees reporting directly to them.
   * peerEmployeesInSameRoleAndDept: A list of colleagues with similar roles and in the same department.
   * currentGroupMemberships: The employee's active group memberships.
   This nested structure provides the LLM with a "graph" or "tree" of information, allowing it to connect dots and understand relationships, which is fundamental for "Tree-of-Thoughts" (ToT) reasoning. Instead of just getting a flat list of data, the LLM receives a pre-organized "thought" structure to build upon.
 * AccessGovernanceService.java (Get_Employee_Context_Graph method):
   The @Tool annotated method getEmployeeContextGraph(String employeeId) in this service is responsible for querying the various repositories (Employee, GroupMembership) and assembling this EmployeeContextGraph object. When the LLM on the client side calls this tool, it receives this comprehensive, structured context. This moves beyond basic retrieval by providing an already contextualized and related set of data points, ready for inferential analysis.
2. Guided by Precise Prompt Instructions for Inferential and Analytical Tasks (MCP Client Side)
On the access-governance-mcp-client side, the AccessGovernanceClientService is where the advanced prompt engineering happens, guiding the LLM to perform inferential and analytical tasks using the structured data from the MCP Server.
Here's how it achieves this:
 * Role-Based System Prompts:
   Each analytical method (recommendAccess, explainAnomaly, explainPolicyDrift) starts with a detailed SystemMessage that assigns a specific persona to the AI (e.g., "expert Access Governance Advisor", "AI Security Analyst", "AI Compliance Officer"). This persona guides the LLM's overall behavior, tone, and focus, ensuring it aligns with security and compliance objectives.
 * Step-by-Step Reasoning Instructions (Chain-of-Thought / Tree-of-Thoughts):
   Within these SystemMessages, explicit, numbered instructions are provided to the LLM, outlining a multi-step reasoning process. For example, in recommendAccess:
   * "Use the 'Get_Employee_Context_Graph' tool... to understand their organizational context."
   * "Analyze the 'employeeDetails', 'lineManagerDetails', 'directReports', and 'peerEmployeesInSameRoleAndDept' from the context graph."
   * "Pay close attention to the 'currentGroupMemberships' of the line manager and peers."
   * "Based on the new joiner's department, role, and the access patterns of their manager and peers, suggest a minimal set of group memberships."
   * "For each recommended group, provide a clear justification..."
   This "Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) or "Tree-of-Thoughts" (ToT) style prompting forces the LLM to break down the problem, process the structured data from the MCP server systematically, and then synthesize an analytical response, rather than just retrieving facts.
 * Explicit Tool Invocation Guidance:
   The system prompts explicitly tell the LLM which tools to use and when to use them (e.g., "You must use the 'Detect_Access_Anomalies' tool..."). This ensures the LLM leverages the rich data exposed by your MCP Server for its analysis.
 * Structured Output with BeanOutputParser:
   Each analytical method on the client side (recommendAccess, explainAnomaly, explainPolicyDrift) uses a BeanOutputParser (e.g., new BeanOutputParser<>(AccessRecommendation.class)).
   * The parser.getFormat() method injects a JSON schema directly into the system prompt, explicitly telling the LLM the exact JSON structure it must adhere to for its output.[1, 2, 3, 4]
   * The application.yml for the client also sets spring.ai.openai.chat.options.responseFormat.type=json_object to further encourage JSON output from the OpenAI model.
   * This ensures that the LLM's analytical output is not free-form text, but a machine-readable JSON object (e.g., AccessRecommendation, AnomalyExplanation, PolicyDriftExplanation POJOs), making it directly actionable by your application.
In summary, the provided code for both the MCP Server and Client works in tandem: the MCP Server provides the necessary structured, contextual data via its tools, and the MCP Client uses sophisticated prompt engineering techniques to guide the LLM to perform deep inferential and analytical tasks on that data, delivering actionable, structured insights for access governance.
